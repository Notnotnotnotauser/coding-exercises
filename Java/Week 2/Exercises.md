# Week 2 Exercises
#### Due at 3/21 by 3PM
## Project 1: Basic Calculator
### Overview
In this project, you will build a basic calculator program in Java. The calculator will perform the following arithmetic operations:
* Addition
* Subtraction
*	Multiplication
* Division
* Modulus

### Step 1: Create the Calculator Class
* Create a new Java file called Calculator.java
* Define a class called `Calculator`.

### Step 2: Add Methods for Operations
Inside the class, create methods for each mathematical operation:
* `+` operator for `add()`
* `-` operator for `subtract()`
* `*` operator for `multiply()`
* `/` operator for `divide()`
* `%` operator for `mod()`

Each method should:
* Take two numbers as parameters
* Return the result

### Step 3: Create the Calculator
Add a main() method to test your calculator.

Inside main, create a Calculator object called ```myCalculator```.

### Step 4: Call the Methods
Create variables and test the calculator.

Example:
```java
System.out.println(myCalculator.add(5, 7));
System.out.println(myCalculator.subtract(10, 3));
System.out.println(myCalculator.multiply(4, 6));
System.out.println(myCalculator.divide(20, 5));
System.out.println(myCalculator.mod(9, 2));
```

## Project 2: Build A Droid
### Project Overview
In this project, you will create a program that models a droid robot.

### Step 1: Create the Droid Class
* Create a file called Droid.java
* Define a class called `Droid`

### Step 2: Add Instance Variables
Give each droid some properties.
Declare the variables `name` for the droid's name and `energyLevel` for the power left inside the class, but don't initialize them yet.

### Step 3: Create a Constructor
* Create a constructor that has `droidName` as a parameter
* Set `name` to `droidName`

### Step 4: Add a `performTask()` Method
This method should:
* Print a message about the droid doing work
* Reduce the energy level by 10

### Step 5: Add an `energyReport()` Method
Create a method that prints the energy remaining in the droid.

### Step 6: Add a `recharge()` Method
Create a method that increases the droid’s energy by 20 and prints that the droid is charging.

## Exercise 1: Modeling a Book
### Objective
Create a Java program that models a **`Book`** object.

### Requirements
* Make a `Book` class with variables for `title`, `author`, and `pages`. Add a method called `describe()` that prints a sentence describing the book.
* Create another class with a `main` method. In `main`, create **at least two `Book` objects**, assign values to their variables, and call their `describe()` methods to display information about each book.
* **Modify one of the book’s page counts** (for example, if a new edition added pages) and print the updated value.
* Add a **constructor** to the `Book` class that allows you to set the title, author, and pages when creating a book, then use it to create a **third `Book` object** and call its `describe()` method.

## Exercise 2: The Digital Pet Creator
### Objective
You are going to create a Pet class. This class will act as a blueprint to create different pet objects, each with its own name and energy level.

### Part 1: Defining the Class
Create a file named Pet.java. Inside, define your class with two Instance Variables:
 * `String name` (The pet's name)
 * `int energyLevel` (A number from 0 to 100)

### Part 2: The Constructor
Add a Constructor to your class. This is the special method that runs when you create a new pet. It should:
 * Take two parameters: `petName` and `startingEnergy`.
 * Assign those parameters to your instance variables (`name` and `energyLevel`).

### Part 3: Adding Behavior (Methods)
Create two methods inside your Pet class:
 * `play()`: This method should print a message saying the pet is playing and decrease the energyLevel by 10.
 * `feed()`: This method should print a message saying the pet is eating and increase the energyLevel by 15.
 * `status()`: This method should print the pet's current name and energy level (e.g., "Rex has 85% energy left.").

### Part 4: Testing in Main
In your Main.java file (or inside your main method):
 * Instantiate (create) at least two different Pet objects (e.g., a dog named "Buddy" and a cat named "Luna").
 * Call the `status()` method for both pets.
 * Make one pet play and the other pet eat.
 * Call `status()` again to see how their energy levels changed.

### Key Concepts to Remember
 * The Blueprint: The Pet class is the cookie cutter; the individual pets you create are the cookies.
 * Dot Notation: Use the dot (e.g., `myPet.play()`) to tell a specific object to perform an action.
 * Case Sensitivity: Remember that String is capitalized in Java, but int is not!
